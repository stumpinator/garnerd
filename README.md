# garnerd
utilities for storing, cataloging, hashing, and generating metadata for files

garnerd is designed to collect, index, and perform basic analysis of files. Metadata is used to sort and track files using hash based deduplication.

Contains hashing helper classes. This includes a multiprocessing enhanced version with much better speed and efficiency than typical python hashing design patterns.
